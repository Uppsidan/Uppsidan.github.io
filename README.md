# Uppsidan

This is pretty cool.

I can edit my files here in the [repo](https://github.com/Uppsidan/Uppsidan.github.io) and then it is compiled to a web site at 
[Github Pages](https://uppsidan.github.io/)

The template framework is called jekyll and it has many different themes to make a static website. This theme is made for SW documentation. There are other themes for blogging or portfolios or whatever.

Jekyll has become popular, partly because it is used on Github Pages. Free hosting is good. Simple markdown pages and some small configuration. No database. No special tools.
